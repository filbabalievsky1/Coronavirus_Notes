    "One goal of this model, aside from perhaps getting more reasonable predictions, is to be able to estimate \"deeper\" parameters (via indirect inference) from social interaction data, empirical estimates of $R_0$, and estimates of the share of infections from super-spreaders. One such parameter, outlined in more detail below, controls whether prolonged exposure is needed to transmit the virus. Then we could use those parameters to assess whether social distancing measures that limit fleeting interactions are useful or not. These include park closures, mass transit cuts, and restrictions on where people can walk as is done now in Italy ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/22/business/bc-eu-virus-outbreak-italy-restrictions.html)). As we will probably live with this nightmare for a long time, it will be useful to study which restrictions are actually slowing the disease and which are just driving us insane, and (slowly! carefully!) relax the latter as evidence builds for their inefficacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimation procedure would be as follows:\n",
    "- Fill in a symmetrical sparse matrix of social interactions (maybe parameterized based on on smartphone location data). Element $i,j$ tells us how much time $i$ and $j$ spend in close proximity with each other on average, normalized between 0 and 1\n",
    "- For each row $i$ of the data, simulate forward as if only $i$ was infected. Use a simple parametric function that takes as an input the amount of time $i$ spends with $j$, and spits out a probability that $j$ will get infected. In each period $i$ recovers with some probability and stops spreading new infections\n",
    "- After simulating forward for a few periods, we get a vector where each element $i$ indicates the number of people that $i$ has infected. The mean of the elements targets $R_0$; the share infections generated by super-spreaders helps pin down a parameter that governs whether sustained interactions are necessary to spread the disease or if even fleeting interactions can do the trick"
